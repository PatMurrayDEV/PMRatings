A drop-in button or label to _politely_ encourage users to review your app on the App Store. Created by [Pat Murray](https://twitter.com/_patmurray) and inspired by [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org)'s [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) app:

The problem with how iOS apps ask [for](https://david-smith.org/blog/2013/12/16/degradation-or-aspiration/) [ratings](http://www.macworld.com/article/1159659/app_developers_behavior.html) [has](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/12/05/eff-your-review) [been](http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/02/04/begging-for-app-ratings/) [long](http://dancounsell.com/articles/prompting-for-app-reviews) [discussed](http://www.apptentive.com/blog/ratings-prompts-dont-have-to-suck-inside-mobile-apps/) [online](http://www.marco.org/2011/05/05/apps-prompting-for-reviews). Marco outlines, in his post [_How Overcast asks for reviews_](http://www.marco.org/2014/12/05/how-overcast-asks-for-reviews), a less intrusive way of asking for ratings. I implemented this is my app [NCIS: Gibbs' Rules](http://rules.patmurray.co) to much success.

## Overview
#### Briefly
PMRatings can be used in two main ways:  
- As a `UITableViewCell` subclass for adding an Overcast style button to your settings screen
- To return a `NSString` to be used in your own controls.

PMRatings can be used in both locale independent or locale focused mode. Locale independent gets ratings from the US store, locale focused gets ratings from the user's local store. PMRatings caches the most up to date ratings count in `NSUserDefaults`.

#### Current State
Current version is pre-0.1. Much work is still to happen. I would not reccomend using this in any app (shipping or not)
